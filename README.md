# 📘 JOVAC_ASSIGNMENT_NAIVE_BAYES_DECISION_TREES_AND_ENSEMBLE_LEARNING

This project contains implementations of various machine learning classification models using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📁 Files

- `1_Naive_Bayes_Classifier.ipynb` – Naive Bayes classification
- `2_Decision_Trees.ipynb` – Decision Tree model
- `3_Ensemble_Learning_Bagging_Boosting_RandomForest.ipynb` – Ensemble learning models
- `email.csv` – Dataset used in Naive Bayes (likely for spam classification)

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Bagging & Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting)

## ✅ How to Run

1. Open each `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to train and evaluate models.
